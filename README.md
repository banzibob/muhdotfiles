These are my dotfiles.  
The goal is to keep it relatively simple, sensible, and easy to follow without leaving tmux / vim while in the workflow.  

You still shouldn't just copy-paste this unless you know what functionality it is you are getting.  

utilities like fzf, ag, tmux, vim, will be brought down and built from src  
since the architecture and OS may vary on each machine, i think this would be best  

you can just clone this and 
```
make world
```
if you are set on using this 

I also have made branches for the various devices i have to work on
