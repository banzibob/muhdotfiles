These are my dotfiles.
The goal is to keep it relatively simple, sensible, and easy to follow without leaving tmux / vim while in the workflow.  

You still shouldn't just copy-paste this unless you know what functionality it is you are getting.  

utilities like fzf, ag, tmux, vim, will be brought down and built from src...eventually  
you are just going to have to build from src yourself for now.   
and until it's actually building from src and installing the utils, I would suggest just manually installing vim, tmux, fzf, and ag. 

to install, clone this project and  
```
make world
```

What can you now do?
